	            <p class="s20">Pastor Walter is our lead pastor. Creative City Worship started with a bunch of people who are passionate about God and passionate to serve others. We strongly believe that our God-given talents should be used to serve the city we are in, so that people can come to know who Jesus is and can worship Him in spirit and in truth.<br><br>We started our first Creative City Worship service on November 10th, 2013 with only 12 members. Having only a small amount of volunteers meant that everyone had to multi-task, and on every Sunday one person could have up to 3 ministries! But this has caused us to grow closer to one another and Sunday service became more than just an ordinary church service - it became our extended family gathering to worship God and rejoice in His presence.<br><br>Ever since then we've had tremendous miracles in the house of God - new members were added, many volunteered to serve, and we've even been given the opportunity to dedicate 4 young children to God and to baptize our first member on Easter Sunday, 20 April 2014. </p>
